# Unexpected Behavior in Ruby Getter/Setter Methods

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in Ruby classes when using getter and setter methods. The bug is related to unexpected behavior that might arise from improper implementation of the setter method or interactions from external parts of the application. 

## Bug Description
The `MyClass` example seems to work correctly at first glance.  However, under certain scenarios or if the setter is not correctly implemented, it can lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption.  For instance,  if another part of the application attempts to modify the instance variable in a way not handled by the setter, inconsistencies may arise. 

## Solution
The solution involves carefully designing and implementing setter methods to handle various scenarios and potential issues in a robust manner.  Consider adding input validation or error handling within the setter to prevent invalid assignments.
